# advanced_UAV_conf

This repository contains a Python script for generating and evaluating **advanced UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)** configurations using parameterized geometry through the `opensvp` API and basic performance placeholders.

## Overview
The main function `DesignSpace(nconfig, Xlimits)`:
1. Generates UAV design points using **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)** from the `smt` library.
2. Builds each configuration in `opensvp`:
   - **Wing**: aspect ratio, taper, sweep, dihedral, area.
   - **Tail**: aspect ratio, taper, sweep, dihedral, area.
   - **Fuselage**: fore/mid/aft lengths, diameter.
3. Updates the model and runs placeholder analyses:
   - Aerodynamic performance
   - Structural performance
   - Radar cross section (RCS) performance
   - Weight estimation
4. Stores all design variables and computed metrics in a **Pandas DataFrame**.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Paused** â€“ Development is currently on hold.  
The script runs and produces a DataFrame with mock performance results, but the analysis functions are placeholders and the integration with the UAV modeling API needs verification.

## Missing or Pending Work
- **Real implementations** for:
  - `AerodynamicsPerformance`
  - `StructuralPerformance`
  - `RadarCrossSectionPerformance`
  - `Weights`
- **Integration checks** with `opensvp`:
  - Confirm import (`opensvp` vs `openvsp`)
  - Validate parameter and group names (e.g., `"Aspect"`, `"WingGeom"`, `"XSec_0"`)
- **Validation and error handling**:
  - Ensure `len(Xlimits) == 14` and values are within valid ranges
  - Handle geometry creation or update errors
- **Reproducibility**:
  - Add random seed for LHS
- **Execution safety**:
  - Move example call under `if __name__ == "__main__":` to prevent unintended execution on import
- **Optional improvements**:
  - Save generated designs and results to file
  - Add docstrings, type hints, and a `requirements.txt`

## Example Usage
```python
result = DesignSpace(10, [(0, 1) for _ in range(14)])
print(result)
